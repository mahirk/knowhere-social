# Knowhere

### Etymology:
> While no one knows exactly how Knowhere came to be, but it is the last known place in all creation. It drifts closer to the edge of the universe until one day it will cease to exist, but before that happens, all different species from all different points in space and time come to Knowhere to study and observe the end of the universe from the closest accessible structure. You can read about it [here](http://marvel.com/universe/Knowhere).
